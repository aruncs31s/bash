**Important thing to note** _You can get full usage of almost any command in linux usig --help option with_ _sometimes -h also works and do the same_
eg:

```
> pwd --help
```

output

```
pwd: pwd [-LP]
    Print the name of the current working directory.                                                                                                            Options:
      -L        print the value of $PWD if it names the current working directory
      -P        print the physical directory, without any symbolic links

    By default, `pwd' behaves as if `-L' were specified.
                                                                                  Exit Status:
    Returns 0 unless an invalid option is given or the current directory
    cannot be read
```

## ***more about this below***

### ***mkdir***
  *[`mkdir`](#mkdir) (make directory)*  is used to create directory(folder) or miltiple directories (folders)

*we can create a folder called new-directory using mkdie*

```
$ mkdir new-folder

```

![mkdir](./bash/images/ls-mkdir.png)
[`mkdir`](#mkdir)o list out folders and files the current working directory



*we can also create multiple directories using [`mkdir`](#mkdir)* 


![cd-mkdir](./bash/images/cd-mkdir.png)

![multiple-mkdir](./bash/images/multiple-mkdir.png)

*we can see that if we type more names after  [`mkdir`](#mkdir) it creates mutliple [`directory`](../Dictionary#directory)*

*So the basic syntax of mkdir is*

```
$ mkdir <foldername> <foldername2> ...

```
learn more about `mkdir`     [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/mkdir)


### ***ls***

_Normaly bash program will be situated under the /bin folder where almost all the user executable programs contains you can take a look at what inside that folder by_

```
$ ls /bin
```

_so we used `ls` to list all the files_

<img src="https://github.com/aruncs31s/bash/blob/main/images/ls.png?raw=true">






*we can give some arguments to the ls command which will produce diffrent outputs*
*for example "-lh" argument combined with `ls` will show you the size of that file*

![](https://github.com/aruncs31s/bash/blob/main/images/ls%20-lh.png?raw=true)

> -l is used to use a long listing format

> -h is used to make it human readable 

*Learn more about  `ls`  [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/ls) 






### ***pwd***
  *`pwd` is used to know your [current directory](../Dictionar#current-directory)*

![pwd](./bash/images/pwd.png)

*The /home/aruncs folder have an nother property it is yout home path*

## Paths

**HOME**
*home path will be always be your /home/username unless you cange it*

![home](./bash/images/echo%20%24HOME.png)

*Also `~` this symbol is linked to HOME variable/reference*

![~](./bash/images/echo%20~.png)
